# n8n Workflow Recommendation System

A comprehensive system for discovering, recommending, and adapting n8n workflow templates based on user requirements using semantic search and pattern matching.

## Overview

This system helps users leverage existing n8n workflow templates instead of building workflows from scratch. It provides intelligent recommendations based on use cases, integrations, and workflow patterns, along with detailed guidance on how to adapt templates to specific needs.

## Purpose
